<h1> The Communist Period </h1>
<h2>In Short:</h2>
<h3>The Socialist Republic of Romania (Romanian: Republica Socialista Romania, RSR) was a Marxist-Leninist one-party communist state that existed officially in Romania from 1947 to 1989. From 1947 to 1965, the state was known as the Romanian People's Republic (Republica Populara Romana, RPR).
</h3>
<h2>Ceausescu and the Romanian Communist Party (1965-1989)</h2>
<h3>Gheorghiu-Dej died in March 1965 and was succeeded by a collective leadership made up of Nicolae Ceausescu as general secretary, Chivu Stoica as president and Ion Gheorghe Maurer as Premier. Ceausescu removed rivals such as Stoica, Alexandru Draghici, and Gheorghe Apostol from the government, and ultimately from the party leadership, and began accumulating posts for himself. By 1969, he was in complete control of the Central Committee. The circumstances surrounding this process are still disputed, but theories evidence that the support given to him by Ion Gheorghe Maurer and Emil Bodnaras, as well as the ascendancy of Ilie Verdet, Virgil Trofin, and Paul Niculescu-Mizil, were instrumental in ensuring legitimacy. Soon after 1965, Ceausescu used his prerogatives to convoke a Party Commission headed by Ion Popescu-Puturi, charged with investigating both Stalinist legacy and Gheorghiu-Dej's purges: resulting in the rehabilitation of a large number of Communist officials (including, among others, Stefan Foris, Lucretiu Patrascanu, Miron Constantinescu, Vasile Luca, and Romanian victims of the Soviet Great Purge). This measure was instrumental in consolidating the new leadership while further increasing its distance from Gheorghiu-Dej's political legacy</h3>
<br>
<h3>Announced by a February 1987 protest of workers and students in Iasi, the final crisis of the PCR and its regime began in the autumn, when industrial employees in Brasov called a strike that immediately drew echoes with the city's population (see Brasov Rebellion). In December, authorities convened a public kangaroo trial of the movement's leaders, and handed out sentences of imprisonment and internal exile.

Inaugurated by Silviu Brucan's public criticism of the Brasov repression, and inspired by the impact of changes in other Eastern Bloc countries, protests of marginalized PCR activists became notorious after March 1989, when Brucan and Parvulescu, together with Gheorghe Apostol, Alexandru Barladeanu, Grigore Raceanu and Corneliu Manescu, sent Ceausescu their so-called Letter of the Six, publicized over Radio Free Europe. At around the same time, systematization provoked an international response, as Romania was subjected to a resolution of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which called for an inquiry into the state of ethnic minorities and the rural population; the political isolation experienced by Communist Romania was highlighted by the fact that Hungary endorsed the report, while all other Eastern bloc countries abstained. This followed more than a decade of deteriorating relations between the PCR and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.

In the face of the changes that unfolded in the rest of Eastern Europe in 1988 and 1989, the PCR retained its image as one of the most unreconstructed parties in the Soviet bloc. It even went as far as to call for a Warsaw Pact invasion of Poland after that country's Communists announced a power-sharing agreement with the Solidarity trade union-a sharp reversal of its previous opposition to the Brezhnev Doctrine and its vehement opposition to the invasion of Czechoslovakia 21 years earlier. It initially appeared that the PCR would ride out the anti-Communist tide sweeping through Eastern Europe when on 24 November-two weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the same day that Communist rule effectively ended in Czechoslovakia-Ceausescu was reelected for another five-year term as General Secretary.

A month later, both Ceausescu and the party were overthrown in the Romanian Revolution of December 1989, begun as a popular rebellion in Timisoara and eventually bringing to power the National Salvation Front, comprising a large number of moderate former PCR members who supported Gorbachev's vision. Having fled the PCR's headquarters under pressure from demonstrators, Ceausescu and his wife were captured, tried, and executed by the new authorities in Targoviste. No formal dissolution of the PCR took place. Rather, the party simply disappeared. The speed with which the PCR, one of the largest parties of its kind, dissolved, as well as its spontaneity, were held by commentators as additional proof that its sizable membership presented a largely false image of its true beliefs. In nearly every other Eastern Bloc country, the former ruling Communist parties recast themselves into social democratic or democratic socialist parties, and remain major players to this day.

Many former members of the PCR have been major players in the post-1989 political scene. For example, until 2014 every post-revolution president had formerly been a member of the PCR. Among other small parties an unregistered party of the same name and the small Romanian Socialist Party claim to be the successors of the PCR, with the latter entering Parliament in the 199-1996 legislature under its former name of Socialist Party of Labour.</h3>
